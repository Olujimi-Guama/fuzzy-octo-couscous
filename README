This project is being provided as-is. It is the 
result of a lot of late nights, early morning, 
weekend tinkering, research, crying, cursing, 
and broken hearts. There are portions that's 
original to Cratylus' Dead Souls mudlib that 
I modified for my needs or entertainment and 
others that are 100% original. Frankly put, 
don't be that d*ck and scrub the credit of any 
contributers and don't take any of this freely 
provided code and try to cash it in. I don't 
know any lawyers but I'm sure someone will love 
to come after you. Oh, and feel free to delete 
this readme file. I was just throwing it togther 
to make my point. 

Also, make sure to lift your arms above the head 
when chocking or coughing. I don't know if that 
helps but it will get someone's attention and 
they can call for help.
