It was during this dawn of the world that KRIOS, whose domain was everywhere as he decreed, has felt ill at 
ease with the empty lands he proclaimed himself to rule. It was then when he was close with the Earth Mother, 
and he not understood patience that was natural of the first immortals. He had wanted order, which his 
siblings wholly help realize, but it was too still. This he expressed the articles of his thoughts and 
reasoning to his Earth Mother. As they discussed, 
others gathered around and also added their thoughts to the discussion.

The last of the Titans
As the Children of the Immortals, the Titans, meditated on the thoughts of filling the vast expanses of the 
earth’s newly formed lands with other things that are not as themselves but not unlike, the Great Mother’s 
lifestream began to run faster upon her skin. The tides grew and rose up, and when they finally slowed, great 
trees in huge forests rose and stood firm much as Coeus stood in his vigil. Beautiful flowers of all colors 
and smaller beasts leap playfully in the majesty of Hyperion’s great splendor. Beasts of the sea and all the 
fishes of all sizes great and small swam through the waters tended by Okanos. Even KRIOS found to his delight 
the hearty and steadfast rams that easily navigated the mountains that were created when he first birthed from 
his mother’s womb. These and many more creatures of all kinds they took delight in.
