Ouranos watched on, curious and unamused. 
To the changes after birthing the immortals, Geaen shifted, 
and moved, attempting to find comfort. This is what is now 
known as earthquakes. For reasons unknown or not understood; 
Ouranos bellowed out and released Hyperion and Coeus, twins 
by birth but much unlike in all else. Hyperion was quick to 
anger, fool hardy, boastful, and handsome. Coeus was silent, 
reasonable, and calculated. It was upon his shoulders he 
lifted the heavens into their final resting place, freeing 
the stars in heaven. From then until the end of days he 
stands silent and vigilant, much as his father had, serving 
as the celestial axis. 

Hyperion, seizing an opportune moment, leap unto his 
brother’s back and took to the sky. Always looking for 
mischief and boasting about his greatness. This was at the 
irritation of his father, insofar he kept to his mother’s 
radiance, always defiant of the night that extruded from his 
father. This is why the sun always follows the day; and 
remains hidden during the night.
