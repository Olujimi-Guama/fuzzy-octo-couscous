It was then where HE, the First Titan, the Great Renderer, twice earned his title. For as Ouranos entered 
unsuspectingly, KRIOS split the ancient across his belly, expecting to free the nephilim that were devoured. 
Instead, he released the darkness inside, and all that Ouranos had devoured has grown twisted inside the 
darkness from within Ouranos. And KRIOS had suffered from the darkness which befell him with the rendering 
of Ouranos, and he fell in pain. Although immortal, the Ancient still bleeds, and this appears in colors 
falling from the sky in the far north. The darkness had frozen the north for all time and always from which 
it landed.
This is when Lapetus stepped forth from the rendered bowels of Ouranos, all the life that was fed to the 
ancient had taken form, and from the fallen Titan he had taken the Great Sickle-- whose edge had tasted the 
flesh and blood of the ancient. He claims it as his birthright, and measures life with it. Cutting it when 
it's time has come. Always close is his little sister, Mnemosyne, whose burden is to carry the great memories 
of the incapacitated Ouranos, for she is his speaker, and through her he speaks.

KRIOS, believed to have suffered too greatly, was laid in the great depths of his motherâ€™s bosom. Here the 
First Titan, the Great Renderer, The Sleeper, story ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

And Ouranos watches, but opinion now he has none.
