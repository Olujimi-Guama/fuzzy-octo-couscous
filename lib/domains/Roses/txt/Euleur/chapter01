In the beginning 
… there was a void we now call the void. “Here” was not, 
and it was a great emptiness. From this nothingness order 
was drawn to allow something other than nothing. There 
is no name to which nothing can exist without and 
everything with-in. It wrought Once in all its infinity 
and begot Chronos. “Now”, “then”, and “will be" become of 
Chronos. Chronos, through no intent nor malice, measured 
the Cosmos. This is how now was released from then and came 
to be and those who dwell from where there has been no 
beginning nor end and that is. It was then that, through 
no means understood by mortals, the First Children were 
revealed.
