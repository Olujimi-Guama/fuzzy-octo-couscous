But Ouranos watched, and not pleased
It was finally the appearance of a creature of a different kind that finally moved Ouranos to take action. 
Ever irritated at Hyperion, here came a creature that was very much alike to him but much smaller and clever. 
Ouranos watched, and was not pleased. The creatures did not look to the Titans and revel in their presence like 
the others but took great pride in themselves. The Titans, believing these creatures a gift from The Elders, had 
wanted to teach them in all that they knew. Ouranos watched, and was not pleased. KRIOS, wanting accord with his 
father, rose to his bosom to reason with him. Nephilim, he said and named unto these creatures meaning 
“We-form-them” in the common tongue. But Ouranos heart has given no quarter to his children’s desire. And instead 
of embracing them, Ouranos breathed out cyclones that ravaged the lands that they inhabited and brought them unto 
him, and he devoured them whole. These were the first cyclones, which in their path the first deserts were formed.

The Rendering of Night
The Titans ran and cried out against this great injustice. It was then when KRIOS, still good and just, decided to 
free the creatures he named nephilim. And it was then that he summoned the titans to craft a sickle, imbued with 
their graces. He then instructed Coeus, whom Ouranos favored, to his domains to the north.
