Chaos had not beginning nor end. 

Geaen, the Earth Mother, took shape and form. From her 
very essence streams the bonds of all Lives. It is from 
her glow we have day. Ouranos, The Un-Earth that cradles 
Geaen, for all things Geaen he is naught. He is of the 
still and darkness where Geaen's touch does not reach.
