The first children of the Earth Mother and her consort.
After the passing of time that only Chronos would measure 
the Earth Mother began to feel a great uneasiness within. 
Ouranos offered no comfort but looked on to the Earth 
Mother he cradled so close. It was then that KRIOS sprung 
from her womb, leaving great tears along Geaen’s body. It 
was here where the first mountains rose and deep valleys 
sank. The sudden rendering was not limited to Geaen’s 
domain. Fragments of her hard skin embedded themselves 
through sheer force into Ouranos, and this is when Wormwood 
came to be. But that is another tale that will not be told 
here. KRIOS, being the first of the coming of the immortals, 
named himself God, and the Great Ruler and Lord of all who 
followed.

Not long after, as the passing of time one would consider 
for immortals, came Okeanos. He rose from the great tearing 
of the Earth Mother’s flesh, in his wake he brought the great 
oceans and seas to fill the gaps in Geaen’s flesh. He lorded 
over all the waters in the world which soothed the Great Earth 
Mother to great extents.
